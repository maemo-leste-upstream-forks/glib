Subject: gvdb-builder: Initialise some memory to zero in the bloom filter
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Until a bloom filter is implemented, we need to ensure that all the
memory returned by `file_builder_allocate()` is initialised, since itâ€™s
not initialised at allocation time.
